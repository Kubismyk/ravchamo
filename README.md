The logic is simple: when you are bored with the food you eat all the time and want to try something new, you can open the application. You just need to click the button in the center of the application, and it will automatically suggest a new food. It's possible that you may not like the new food, so you can keep clicking the button until you find your favorite one. Once you have found your favorite, you can click the "Google it" button located under the main button in the center, to get additional information.

To accommodate vegan or vegetarian users of this app, I have created special menus for them. These menus can be accessed by toggling the switch located in the Viewcontroller, which is located at the top right corner of the screen.
